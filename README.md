# Algorithm Design with Haskell - PureScript Exercises

This repo implements solutions in PureScript, a strict functional programming language, for the exercises in the book, ["Algorithm Design with Haskell" by Richard S. Bird and Jeremy Gibbons](https://archive.org/details/richard-bird-jeremy-gibbons-algorithm-design-with-haskell-cambridge-university-press-2020/mode/2up), which uses Haskell, a lazy functional programming language.

The main contribution here is that solutions cannot depend on laziness, which is used heavily throughout the book.
